``Gaussian_Kernel_DensityEstimation.py``: Estimating the density of distribution with Gaussian Kernel. The width of kernel is chosen by the likelyhood cross validation. 

``Gaussian_Kernel_LSR.py``: Classification of MNIST's images to 10 classes by using Gaussian Kernel Regression. The least square loss is minimized as a optimization.  

``Gaussian_Kernel_crossval.py``:Deciding hyper parameters of l_2 norm and width by using cross validation. 

``Gaussian_Kernel_sparse.py`` : Estimating parameters of Linear Regression by using Gaussian Kernel Model and a sparse regression.

``KNN.py``: Classification of MNIST's images to 10 classes by using KNN. The number of K is decided by cross validation. 

``Tokey_loss.py``: Liner model of Tokey regression, which is robust.   

``SVM.py``: Linear SVM implementation using gradient descent algorithm.

``LDA.py``: Conducting Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify data from two different distribusions.
